Me
=========
Hi, I'm Vincent Costel, a web developer living in Montr√©al, Canada. Originally a .Net developer, I find myself writing mainly JavaScript code lately. And I like it.  
Also I'm French, so pardon my English.

This blog
=========

This blog is powered by [Jekyll][1], a static site generator. Yep, no database.  
It is hosted on [GitHub][2].  
The too familiar look is due to the use of [Twitter Bootstrap][3] and my lack of design skills.
